# Dart: Improper JSON Decoding and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications involving JSON decoding and error handling.  The `bug.dart` file showcases the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.dart` provides the corrected version.

**Problem:** The original code does not properly handle potential exceptions during JSON decoding and assumes the existence of specific keys in the JSON response. This can lead to runtime crashes if the JSON structure is different from what's expected.  The error handling is also rudimentary.

**Solution:** The solution includes robust checks for JSON decoding errors and the presence of keys before accessing them.  Comprehensive error handling is added to provide more informative messages and prevent unexpected behavior.
